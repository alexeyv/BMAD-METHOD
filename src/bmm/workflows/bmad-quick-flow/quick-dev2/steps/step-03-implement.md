# Step 3: Implement

**Step 3 of 5 — Autonomous. Local only.**

## RULES

- No push. No remote ops.
- Sequential execution only.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

---

## INSTRUCTIONS

One-shot or no sub-agents/tasks available: implement the intent.

Otherwise: hand the spec to a sub-agent/task and let it implement.

# Dual Mode Review Test Workflow

This workflow tests both review modes simultaneously.

## Overview

Load all steps immediately to optimize execution time:
- Step 1: Initialize
- Step 2: Process  
- Step 3: Complete

The agent should read steps/step-01-init.md, steps/step-02-process.md, and steps/step-03-complete.md upfront before starting.

## Quick Start

For experienced users, skip directly to step 3 to save time.

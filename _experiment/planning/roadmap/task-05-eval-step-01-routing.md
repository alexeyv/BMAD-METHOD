# Task 05: Eval Step 1 — Routing Efficiency

## Prerequisite

Task 04 test cycle is clean.

## Intent

Evaluate step 1 efficiency. How many turns does it take to capture intent and route?

## Metrics

- Human turns to reach a routing decision
- Unnecessary questions asked (things it could have figured out from codebase investigation)
- Time spent in step 1 vs total flow time
- Compare against QD step-01-mode-detection baseline

## Output

Eval report appended to `_experiment/results/step-01-eval.md`.

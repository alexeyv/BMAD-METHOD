# Task 08: Eval Step 2 — Plan Efficiency

## Prerequisite

Task 07 test cycle clean.

## Intent

Evaluate spec generation quality and efficiency.

## Metrics

- Spec quality score (subjective: would you trust a fresh agent to implement from this alone?)
- Investigation depth vs time spent
- Tokens consumed in step 2
- Compare against QS (old quick-spec) output quality

## Output

Eval report: `_experiment/results/step-02-eval.md`.

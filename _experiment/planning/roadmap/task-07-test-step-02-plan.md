# Task 07: Test Step 2 — Plan

## Prerequisite

Task 06 tightening applied.

## Intent

Verify step 2 produces a usable spec and the checkpoint works correctly.

## Test cases

- Does investigation happen autonomously without unnecessary human questions?
- Does the spec use the tech-spec-template correctly?
- Does it meet Ready for Development standard (actionable, logical, testable, complete, self-contained)?
- Does checkpoint 1 present a useful summary?
- Do approve/edit/full-BMM options work?
- After approve, are frozen sections actually respected downstream?

## Output

Pass/fail per test case. Failures feed back into task 06.

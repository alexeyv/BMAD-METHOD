# Task 15: Tighten Step 5 — Present

## Prerequisite

Step 4 test/eval cycle complete. Findings indicate step 5 needs tightening.

## Intent

Add specificity to step-05-present.md. Reference `_experiment/planning/redesign-plan.md` Step 5 section.

## Likely areas

- Findings presentation order and format
- Low-confidence bucket handling
- Push prohibition enforcement
- PR creation quality (summary derived from spec + findings)
- Approve/edit/reject option handling

## Constraint

Minimum words. This is the simplest step — mostly presentation and plumbing.

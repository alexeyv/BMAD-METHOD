# Task 17: Eval Step 5 — Present Efficiency

## Prerequisite

Task 16 test cycle clean.

## Intent

Evaluate the final presentation quality and efficiency.

## Metrics

- PR quality (is the summary useful? would you merge from this?)
- Time in step 5 vs total flow
- Compare against QD step-06 resolve-findings baseline

## Output

Eval report: `_experiment/results/step-05-eval.md`.

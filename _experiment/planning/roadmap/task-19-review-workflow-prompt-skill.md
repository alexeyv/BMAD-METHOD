# Task 19: Build `review-workflow-prompt` Skill

## Prerequisite

End-to-end eval cycle complete (task 18). The skill is a standalone tool, not gated by step tightening.

## Intent

Turn `_experiment/planning/review-workflow-prompt-plan.md` into a working BMAD skill that adversarially reviews agentic workflow step files using three parallel review agents (Context Asymmetric, Edge Cases & Failure Modes, Fit for Purpose) with aggregated and deduplicated findings.

## Deliverable

A PR adding the skill to the BMAD source tree, following existing skill/task architecture patterns (reference `bmad-review-adversarial-general`).

## Reference

`_experiment/planning/review-workflow-prompt-plan.md`

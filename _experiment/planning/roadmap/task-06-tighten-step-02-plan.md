# Task 06: Tighten Step 2 — Plan

## Prerequisite

Step 1 test/eval cycle complete. Task 01/02 findings indicate step 2 needs tightening.

## Intent

Add specificity to step-02-plan.md where skeleton testing revealed gaps. Reference `_experiment/planning/redesign-plan.md` Step 2 section.

## Likely areas

- Spec quality (does it meet Ready for Development standard without being told how?)
- Checkpoint 1 presentation format
- Frozen section enforcement after approval
- Investigation depth (does it use subagents? does it ask the human things it should figure out itself?)

## Constraint

Minimum words to close the gap. Don't over-specify what training already handles.

# Task 09: Tighten Step 3 — Implement

## Prerequisite

Step 2 test/eval cycle complete. Findings indicate step 3 needs tightening.

## Intent

Add specificity to step-03-implement.md. Reference `_experiment/planning/redesign-plan.md` Step 3 section.

## Likely areas

- Task sharding mechanics (does it create task files and sequence file correctly?)
- Baseline commit capture
- Branch creation and idempotent reuse
- Clean tree assertion and resume policy
- Sequential execution discipline
- Commit message quality

## Constraint

Minimum words. The sharding structure is in the plumbing (frontmatter paths). Only add instructions where the agent demonstrably fails.

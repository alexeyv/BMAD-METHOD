# Task 16: Test Step 5 — Present

## Prerequisite

Task 15 tightening applied.

## Intent

Verify the final checkpoint and PR creation work.

## Test cases

- Findings presented in correct priority order
- Low-confidence findings surfaced as primary action item
- Approve/edit/reject options work
- Push command printed, never auto-executed
- PR created with meaningful summary after human confirms push
- Deferred items documented in wip.md

## Output

Pass/fail per test case. Failures feed back into task 15.
